# 3D-raycasting-renderer
A basic ray casting "3D" renderer made with C++ and SFML

How to use:
1) Press Esc to toggle first-person view or map-editor mode.
2) In first-person view move with the arrow keys and look arround using the mouse.
3) Right click in map-editor mode to toggle the field-of-vision on/off.
4) Left click to draw walls In map-editor mode.

The mechanics are the same as the ray casting algorithm.
